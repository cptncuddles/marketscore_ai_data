Leveraging knowledge of Apache Spark and Python I was tasked with setting up a pipeline and maintaining a
data warehouse for future use by a generative AI in the use of day trading. Required extensive knowledge of data
cleaning and formatting as well as an introduction into machine learning via PyTorch. This project is ongoing with
the most current iteration moving away from a RDD with Spark and into a NoSQL Database using MongoDB.
